    "description": "A role-based library management system built with NestJS and Next.js, supporting real-time coordination and secure user workflows.",
    "details": "LibraryHub is a comprehensive full-stack library management system developed using NestJS for the backend and Next.js for the frontend. It is designed to streamline library operations through real-time synchronization and role-based access control. The system supports three user roles: Admin, Librarian, and Student, each having a separate dashboard with their specific functionalities. Admins can approve or reject newly registered librarians, manage users, add, update, and delete books, change transaction statuses like issue or return, and temporarily block students. Librarians can manage the book inventory, handle book requests from students, and carry out regular library tasks after admin approval. Students can view available books, send book requests, and track their request and transaction statuses. The system features secure authentication using JWT, OTP-based password reset via email, and profile management for all users. All actions are instantly synchronized across the system to ensure real-time updates. This project demonstrates seamless frontend-backend integration, clean API design, and a focus on usability, security, and maintainability.",
