              Hello, I’m Md. Sazzad Hossain, a passionate and aspiring mobile
              app developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science and
              Engineering. Currently in my 8th semester at American
              International University – Bangladesh. I have developed hands-on
              experience in Object-Oriented Programming, competitive
              programming, and Flutter app development. I’ve worked on various
              projects that showcase my skills, including UniGuide, a university
              admission guide app built in Java, a Roll Dice App created using
              Flutter and a Inventory Management System using C#. Through these
              projects, I have honed my technical abilities, problem-solving
              skills, and creativity in building efficient and user-friendly
              applications. In addition to my technical expertise, I have
              experience collaborating with teams and organizing events as a
              former member of the AIUB Performing Arts Club, where I developed
              strong communication and teamwork skills. Volunteering with Sheba
              Foundation has also taught me adaptability and the importance of
              giving back to the community. I am highly motivated to start my
              career as a mobile app developer and am enthusiastic about
              leveraging my skills to create innovative solutions. With a strong
              work ethic, a passion for coding, and a drive to tackle
              challenges, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
              Let’s connect to explore how I can bring value to your team or
              project!
